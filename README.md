# What-s-Your-Fortune

This assignment was to generate a password by answering questions of how long the password should be and if the letters should be capital or lower case and if you want any sumbols. After answering these questions, you should be given a password randomly generated. If you did not say a number between the options given then you would be propmted back and asked to only choose between the two.

My assignemnt asks the full question but does not generate the password.
